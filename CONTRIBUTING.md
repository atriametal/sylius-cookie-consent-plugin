Thank you for considering a contribution! By participating in this project, you agree to abide by its
[Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Reporting a bug or suggesting a feature

Open an issue with the [bug report or feature request form](https://github.com/atriametal/sylius-cookie-consent-plugin/issues/new/choose). For security issues, do **not** open an issue: follow
[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## Submitting a pull request

1. Fork the repository and create a branch from `main`.
2. Install the dependencies: `composer install`.
3. Write a test that fails without your change, then make it pass: `vendor/bin/phpunit` for PHP, `node --test tests/Js/*.test.js` for
   the JavaScript.
4. Check the code style and the types: `vendor/bin/ecs check` (Sylius coding standard) and
   `vendor/bin/phpstan analyse`. Keep `declare(strict_types=1);` and the license header in every PHP file.
   The plugin supports Sylius 1.14 and 2.x: see the README to run the tests against another version.
5. Describe the change in the `Unreleased` section of [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).
6. Open the pull request, explaining the problem it solves.

Keep pull requests focused: one change per pull request is easier to review. Changes to the format of the consent cookie
or to the JavaScript API are breaking changes: they would ask every visitor for consent again, or break the
integrations of the applications.
